# Find the config file of static PODs and the path of the directory holding the static pod definition file

ps -aux | grep kubelet
#        OR BETTER

ps -ef | grep kubelet

# that means: look for lines containing 'kubelet' in a detailed overview/snapshot
of all current processes, and display those lines
-e - show all processes, not just those belonging to the user
-f - show processes in full format (more detailed than default)

# then, search for the line --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml to find the config.yaml file
and run the command:

grep -i staticpod /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

# to search 'staticPodPath:' line, that indicates what is the directory holding static pod definition file

# Create a static POD with a command sleep of 1000
kubectl run --restart=Never --image=busybox static-busybox
--dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > /etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-busybox.yaml

# N.B. /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ is the location of static POD config files.

#Explore environment

Run the following command to identify the interface.
root@controlplane:~# ip a OR ip link
OR
root@controlplane:~# ifconfig -a
root@controlplane:~# cat /etc/network/interfaces



What is the MAC address of the interface on the master node?
root@controlplane:~#ip link show eth0


What is the MAC address assigned to node01,
that is a node present (usually masternode) in the same cluster, but in which we are not in?
root@controlplane:~# arp node01
OR
root@controlplane:~# ssh node01 ifconfig node01


Check the interface created by Docker
root@controlplane:~# ip link | grep -i docker


What is the state of the interface docker0?
root@controlplane:~# ip link | grep -i docker | grep state


If you were to ping google from the master node, which route does it take? Check the default gateway
root@controlplane:~# ip route show default
OR
root@controlplane:~# ip r
and search for the first line of results


What is the port the kube-scheduler is listening on in the controlplane node (masternode)?
root@controlplane:~# netstat -nplt | grep -i kube-scheduler
N.B. consider the port binded to the IP address


Notice that ETCD is listening on two ports.
Which of these have more client connections established?
root@controlplane:~# netstat -anp | grep etcd
and search for the most used port


Inspect the kubelet service
root@controlplane:~# ps -aux | grep -i kubelet

## The CNI binaries are located under /opt/cni/bin by default
## For checking what is the CNI plugin configured to be used on a kubernetes cluster,
    check the file inside the folder ls /etc/cni/net.d/
